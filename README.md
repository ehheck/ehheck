- 👋 Hi, I’m @ehheck
- 👀 I’m interested in failing, learning, and doing. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning from others, my failures, and by doing. This tends to be in the realms of web development, marketing, graphic design, and psychology.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects where we can learn or get something done.
- 📫 How to reach me, email: elizabeth.h.heck@gmail.com
